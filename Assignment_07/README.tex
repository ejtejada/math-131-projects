\section{Gauss Seidel Method}
\indent [x, err, N] = gauss_seidel(A,b,x,tol,Nmax)
\indent \indent This function will return an estimate solution to the system Ax=b using gauss-seidel iteration and will stop once we are either within an acceptable error, or have hit our Nmax # of cycles. Vectors A, b, and an initial guess to the system x0 for Ax=b. A desired accuracy 'tol', and a user defined max number of cycles called 'Nmax' must be given as inputs. This function should return the possible solution vector x, the maximum error value, and the N number of cycles we went through (or a graceful failure warning).
