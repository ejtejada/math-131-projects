\section{Euler's Method}
\indent euler_timestep(f,a,b,alpha,N)
\indent \indent This function approximates solution to given first order differential equation. Here, alpha is the initial value to this IVP, N are the max number of cycles allowed, and (b-a)/N its the set time step for this method. Euler's method uses a taylor expansion for y'(t) and truncates the expanded result to only the first two terms (which is great for run time, not so much of accuracy).
