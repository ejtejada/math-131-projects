\section{Gaussian Elimination}
\indent [U, f] = gaussian_elimination(A,b)
\indent \indent This function takes a given square matrix A, a vector 'b'of correct size, and solves A*x = b via fundemental row operations THAT DO NOT alter the column space nor the null space of A such that we get a U matrix and f vector such that U*x = f, and U is either upper triangular or lower triangular. This function must gracefully handle systems with non-unique and non-existant solutions.

\newpage
\section{LU Factorization}
\indent [L,U] = LU_factorization(A)
\indent \indent  This function breaks down a given square matrix A into two equal size square matricies, L and U, such that L is lower triangular, U is upper triangular, and L*U = A by conventional matrix multiplication. This is acheived via backward and forward substitution so as to achieve 'partial pivoting'. This function must gracefully handle systems with non-unique, non-existant solutions, and non-deterministic solutions (families of solutions).
